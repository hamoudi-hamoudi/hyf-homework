        <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the website. If you're here, you're likely looking to find
          random words. Random Word Generator is the perfect tool to help you do
          this. While this tool isn't a word creator, it is a word generator
          that will generate random words for a variety of activities or uses.
          Even better, it allows you to adjust the parameters of the random
          words to best fit your needs
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>
          The first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of random
          words to be generated. You can choose as many or as few as you'd like.
          You also have the option of choosing words that only begin with a
          certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only begin and end
          with certain letters. If you leave these blank, the randomized words
          that appear will be from the complete list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another option you have is choosing the number of syllables of the
          words or the word length of the randomized words. There are also ways
          to further refine these by choosing the "less than" or "greater than"
          options for both syllables and word length. Again, if you leave the
          space blank, the complete list of randomized words will be used. You
          have the option of choosing the types of words you want to be
          displayed using the "Word Type" dropdown. The default is "All" which
          is a curated list of thousands of the more common English words. You
          can also opt to only display nouns, verbs, or adjectives from this
          curated list. If you want to choose from all the words out there, you
          can choose "Extended" which is a list that includes over half a
          million different English words.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in random words in languages other than English,
          you can choose the "Non English" word type. Doing so will give you the
          option to generate words in ten different languages other than
          English. This includes Spanish words, Hindi words, Arabic words,
          German words, Russian words, Chinese words, Japanese words, Korean
          words. Latin words, or Italian words. You simply need to choose the
          language and then words from that language will randomly appear with
          each refresh of the page. Once you have input all of your
          specifications, all you have to do is to press the Generate Random
          Words button, and a list of random words will appear. Below are some
          of the common ways people use this tool.
