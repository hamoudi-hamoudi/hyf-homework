Homemade Hummus Ingredients

You only need 7 basic ingredients to make this easy homemade hummus recipe!

    Cooked chickpeas. Though I cook dried chickpeas on occasion, I typically use store bought canned chickpeas in my homemade hummus, and it always comes out great. If you cook your chickpeas yourself, make sure to soak them ahead of time, and let them boil for a bit longer than you normally would, until they become mushy, soft & creamy.
    Tahini. A good amount of good-quality tahini is the key to smooth hummus. I use 1/3 cup in my recipe, and I choose a brand with a smooth texture and a mild, nutty flavor that’s not bitter. My favorites are Cedar’s (available at most grocery stores), Seed & Mill (the best ever), and Soom.
    Extra-virgin olive oil. I blend 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the dip, and I love to serve it with an extra drizzle of oil on top!
    Fresh lemon juice. Squeeze it yourself for the best bright, zingy flavor.
    Garlic. I use one fresh garlic clove in my basic recipe, but you could also swap in 2 roasted garlic cloves for a caramelized taste.
    Water. I start with 5 tablespoons and add more, as needed, to give it a delectable light, fluffy texture!
    Sea salt. I use 1/2 teaspoon to heighten the bright, nutty flavors in this homemade hummus recipe.
